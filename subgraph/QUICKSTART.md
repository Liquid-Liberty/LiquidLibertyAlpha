```yaml
address: "YOUR_UNISWAP_V2_PAIR_ADDRESS"  # Replace with actual address
startBlock: STARTING_BLOCK_NUMBER         # Replace with actual block
network: "sepolia"                        # Or "mainnet", "polygon", etc.

### 3. Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### 4. Deploy
```bash
# To Graph Studio (recommended)
npm run deploy

# To hosted service
npm run deploy:hosted

# Locally for testing
npm run deploy:local

## üìä Query Your Data

Once deployed, query your OHLCV data:

```graphql
{
  candles(
    where: { pair: "YOUR_PAIR_ADDRESS", interval: "3600" }
    orderBy: bucketStart
    orderDirection: desc
    first: 100
  ) {
    open
    high
    low
    close
    volumeToken0
    volumeToken1
    trades
    bucketStart
  }
}
```

## üåê Deployment Options

| Option | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Graph Studio** | Free, managed service | Production, testing |
| **Hosted Service** | Legacy hosted service | Existing projects |
| **Local** | Self-hosted Graph Node | Development, testing |

## üîë Get Access Tokens

### Graph Studio
1. Go to [Graph Studio](https://studio.thegraph.com/)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Create a new subgraph
4. Copy the access token

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Graph CLI not found"**
```bash
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

**"Codegen fails"**
- Check that all ABIs are valid JSON
- Verify file paths in `subgraph.yaml`

**"Build fails"**
- Run `npm run codegen` first
- Check TypeScript errors

**"Deployment fails"**
- Verify access token is set
- Check network configuration
- Ensure contract address is correct
