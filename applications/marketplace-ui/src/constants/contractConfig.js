// ðŸš¨ DEPRECATED: This file is no longer used for address management
//
// Contract addresses are now managed dynamically through:
// - Network-specific JSON files: src/config/{network}/contract-addresses.json
// - Secure network config: src/utils/secureNetworkConfig.js
// - Address sync utility: scripts/sync-addresses.js
//
// To get current contract addresses, use the appropriate hooks or utilities
// that read from the network-specific configuration files.
//
// This file is kept for reference but should not be imported or used.

// ðŸ’€ REMOVED: Hardcoded addresses (now managed dynamically per network)
// These addresses were local development addresses and are no longer valid:
// - lbrtyAddress, mockDaiAddress, mockWethAddress, mockWbtcAddress, mockPlsAddress
// - lmktAddress, treasuryAddress, paymentProcessorAddress, faucetAddress
