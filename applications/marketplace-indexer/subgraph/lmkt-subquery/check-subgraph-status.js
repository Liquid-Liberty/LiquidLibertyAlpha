🔍 SUBGRAPH STATUS CHECK

Current Pulse Subgraph: QmVtfDG3XHe6uwSNFr38VoRNP7D24pNkmF1tKRyhgKNNyx

📊 Network Status:
- Current Pulse Block: ~22,654,564
- Start Block: 22,602,590
- Blocks to Index: ~51,974

🎯 What to Check in SubQuery Dashboard:

1. Visit: https://app.subquery.network/
2. Find deployment: QmVtfDG3XHe6uwSNFr38VoRNP7D24pNkmF1tKRyhgKNNyx
3. Check indexing progress:
   ✅ "Indexed Height" should be close to 22,654,564
   ✅ "Sync Status" should show "Synced" or actively indexing
   ✅ "Last Update" should be recent

4. Check logs for enhanced debugging:
   ✅ Look for emoji indicators: 🚀, 💰, 🕯️, 💾
   ✅ No error messages with 💥 or ❌

🚨 TESTING READINESS:
- If indexed height is within ~100 blocks of current: READY TO TEST
- If indexed height is far behind: Wait for catch-up
- If errors in logs: Review error messages

The monitoring script is running and will detect new events within seconds!

🎮 READY FOR TESTING!
When you run 'npx netlify dev' and perform transactions:
1. Watch the monitoring script for new events
2. Check SubQuery dashboard logs for processing details
3. Charts should update within 30-60 seconds after events
